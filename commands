### Use a specific conda environment for extensions
conda create -n jupyterlab-extension
conda activate jupyterlab-extension

### Add a new extension using the cookiecutter tool to setup the environment
cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts

### Install javascript packages and run build commands using JLPM. (This is jupyterlabs bundled version of yarn. Can opt to use npm or yarn itself if you prefer)
jlpm install

jlpm labextension install . --no-build 

### To start a jupyterlab instance in watch mode. 
jupyter lab --watch

### Examples of installing some dependencies
jlpm add @jupyterlab/apputils
jlpm add @jupyterlab/application

### To rebuild the extension. (Have to do this step because jupyterlab is using the compiled javascript files in /lib. (does it use webpack to compile!!?))
jlpm run build 

### To link an extension to jupyter
jupyter labextension link . 

### list all installed labextensions (This uses the jupyter command, because the extensions are installed into jupyter)
jupyter labextension list

### run in watch mode
jlpm run watch
