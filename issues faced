jlpm wasnt working. This was due to conda errors. or maybe even node errors.
When i checked the sourcefile for jlpm inside of a /bin directory, it was pointing
to a file in /opt/... which did not exist. The src path itself was working.
The error code was good. I solved the issue by installing miniconda/anaconda again. 
But have to run conda activate and then make the switch. Might have to just reinstall conda again tbh. 
This was not the solution. Instead it was a complete mess up of my PATH variable....

"react" dependency not met. I dont need to install this directly. React is a subdependency which should be automatically installed
when i install the @jupyterlab/ui-components package.
